# Halls Of Aion (fm. Project Keres)

This is one of my more recent gamedev projects. It was to be a sort of roguelike with the feel of the 90's era Dungeons&Dragons games.

If you are unfamiliar with the platform you can open the code in a text editor.

It can be found in **script/[Script_Name]/.gml** and **object/[ObjectName]/.gml**
